# This file contains random forest hyperparameters, plus a brief
# explanation of their purpose.

# Number of trees that will make up the random forest. Adding more trees tends
# to increase predictive power and reduce overfitting, coming at the cost of
# additional computation. There are likely to be diminishing returns as this
# number becomes large.
n_trees: 10

# The maximum number of splits to calculate when growing each tree. A higher
# max_depth should increase the predictive power of each individual tree,
# but may lead to overfitting if it is too high (as the trees are likely to
# become very complex).
max_depth: 4

# A value between 0 - 1, representing the proportion of the total data to
# sample for each tree (bootstrapping). Lowering this below 1 will limit the
# data available for each tree, which will reduce their predictive power
# individually - but on aggregate may help to reduce overfitting.
sample_ratio: 0.6
