# Random Forest from Scratch
Implementing a Random Forest ML algorithm from scratch in Python.


## Running the model

The regression forest can be run via `run_main.py`. Sklearn version is included for comparison in `run_sklearn.py`.

Hyperparameters can be modified for both models in `hyperparams.yaml`.
